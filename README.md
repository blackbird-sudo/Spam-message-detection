# Spam-message-detection
This project is a spam detection system that uses ML to classify text messages as spam. It processes text data with TF-IDF vectorization and trains a Support Vector Machine classifier through grid search optimization. The system evaluates model performance, makes predictions on new messages, and can load the trained model for deployment.
